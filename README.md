## Amount Me

* I am currently working at [Fill it Forward](https://fillitforward.com/about/) as a **Junior Software Developer**. I work as a fullstack developer, utilizing AWS services for managing infrastructure, alongside Node, GraphQL and React for supplementing backend and frontend work.

* I enjoy learning new tools and new concepts every day. I have a particular interest in compilers and how programming languages are designed. I am currently learning how [Tree Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) works for designing a grammar based on [GML](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language.htm)

* I have worked previously as a Game Developer hobbyist under the alias of [LinkUp Games](https://www.linkupgames.com/) and as a game programmer at [Other Ocean Interactive](https://projectwinter.co/)

## Fun Facts

* I love using Neovim as my main text editor. I enjoy creating a custom workflow that is all based in the terminal. You can check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/LinkUpGames/dotfiles) which are updated weekly with small tweaks or new plugins.

* My favorite Linux distribution is [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/). This distro is very reliable while providing daily system updates.

* I enjoy creating video games and currently working on [Ultimate Reality](https://gamejolt.com/games/ultimatereality/406940) in my free time
